## Project Requirements

### Content
​
My portfolio site includes a profile picture, and a 100-word biography in the index.html file. I have included a contact form in my contact.html file. I have a project section in my projects.html file. In the footer of each webpage I have included links to my LinkedIn page, which is my preferred contact method, as well as my Github page. 

### Technical

I have five web pages in my portfolio: the index or home page, and projects, media, newsletter and contact pages. I have included navigation for desktop and mobile versions of the website, which links to the projects, media, newsletter and contact pages. If the user is not on the home page, there is also an option to navigate back. My portfolio has been version controlled with Git and deployed on GitHub pages. I have also implemented responsive design principles, including using flexbox to format my index, projects and media pages. I have used semantic HTML to provide accessibility, by using elements such as head, body, footer and sections.

### Bonus
​
I have different styles for hover states. In the hover state, the buttons on my index page have a shadow and the articles on my index, media and projects pages change colour. I have used JavaScript to the code for my hamburger menu, so that the navigation options are revealed or hidden when the hamburger button is clicked.
